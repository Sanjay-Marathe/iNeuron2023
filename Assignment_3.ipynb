    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Functions reduces the need code which we want to use multiple time in program. Function makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Function code run when it called not when its defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The def statement defines and create a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause and function can called by passing arguments which execute code written in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:One global scope and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. A return value can be used as part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:It returns to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The data type of None is NoneType\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic but this is not python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:It can be called by spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Put line of code that might cause an error in a try clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause and the code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.\n",
    "\n",
